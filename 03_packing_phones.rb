# 2. A business called “The Company” created a new phone called the companyPhone that needs packing to send away for sale. The Company needs to know how many phones in their pretty new packaging (rectangular prisms) that measures: with  width 5cm, length 7.4cm, and depth 4cm we can fit into a box that is 32cm wide,  43cm long and 22.1cm high.
