# The Company has two directors who are passionately disagreeing, they want to fight it out. Being the 
# fantastic human you are, you propose creating a virtual fight to minimise physical harm.
# You need to create a simple fighting game, where two opponents will fight until one of them loses.

# Hints: start by creating a Player class (the instance variables could be name, health and power).
# You’ll need a few methods, consider one that keeps track of whether a player is alive, another one that 
# calculates the impact of hits (decreases the opponents heath by the the amount of the other players power). 
# And a third that outputs the players information.

# You’ll then need to make a fight method that uses a loop to make the players hit one another until  the is 
# alive method returns false for one of them. When the loop is finished (which would mean one of the players 
# has lost), show the players output.

# Then create two Player objects (create a random value for each player’s health and power, make is so that 
# the maximum health value for a player is 200, and the maximum power value is 25) and call the fight method.
