# A slightly different kind of challenge this morning - its ok to leave it and get on with your terminal app if you’d rather.

# The Company has broken the keyboard not their one and only laptop, so can’t get this bit of code to run. What would the output of this code be (without running it on your own computer)? 

#  def fib(num_
#   if num < 2
#      num
#   else
#      fib(num-1) + fib(num-2)
#   end
# end
# puts fib(4)
