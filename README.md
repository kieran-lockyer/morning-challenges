CA Term 1 Ruby Morning Challenges - Student Starter Repo

Students should create a new repo on Github called morning-challenges-term1 and clone it to their laptop. This repo will be used to fetch, complete and push their solutions to the morning challenges.

To fetch the daily challenge, students should add this base repo as a new remote:

```sh
git remote add morning git@github.com:CoderAcademy-BRI/morning-challenges-term1.git
```

Then, each morning, students can get the new challenge with:

```sh
git pull --no-edit morning <branch> && git push origin master
```

Substitute <branch> with the branch name of the challenge for the current day. This will be provided to you each morning on Slack #general.
